Round 8 results and logs
========================

This repository contains results data and logs captured from preview runs (and ultimately the final run) of Round 8 of the Framework Benchmarks project.

Because this data can be quite large, with some log files measuring in gigabytes, starting with Round 8, the results data will not longer be stored in the [main repository](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/).  The separation allows contributors to interact with the main repository without needing to clone past log data.

In the near future, we will publish results from a very-preliminary run for Round 8 (prior to accepting any or many pull requests since Round 7).  Then, as previews are completed and posted for review at the results site, the raw output and logs will be captured here.

No issues are captured in this repository.  Please log issues in the [main repository](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues).
