Round 8 results and logs
========================

This repository contains results data and logs captured from preview runs (and ultimately the final run) of Round 8 of the Framework Benchmarks project.

Because this data can be quite large, with some log files measuring in gigabytes, starting with Round 8, the results data will not longer be stored in the [main repository](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/).  The separation allows contributors to interact with the main repository without needing to clone past log data.

In the near future, we will publish results from a very-preliminary run for Round 8 (prior to accepting any or many pull requests since Round 7).  Then, as previews are completed and posted for review at the results site, the raw output and logs will be captured here.

Because the previous rounds were all originally a part of the Framework Benchmarks proper, they are being captured in the Round-8 results (for the moment, but will likely have a legacy repo set up at some point). These results are currently stored under the appropriate architecture folder (i7, ec2, and win), under previous-rounds, and at a timestamp of their run.

Moving forward, each architecture will remain, but each preview run will simply be a timestamp folder with the raw results file for each test. The newest timestamp folder after a given round is released will be the final.

No issues are captured in this repository.  Please log issues in the [main repository](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues).
